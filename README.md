# EX1-SOLUTION-TO-A-SYSTEM-OF-LINEAR-EQUATIONS
## AIM:
To write a python program to find a solution to a system of linear equations.
## EQUIPMENT'S REQUIRED:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: 
Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array()
### Step 3: 
Using the np.linalg.solve(), we can find the solutions.
### Step 4: 
End the program
## PROGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT: 
Thus the solutions for the linear equations are successfully solved using python program
